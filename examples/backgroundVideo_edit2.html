		<p>social media's effects on architectural discourse</p>
		</div>
	</div>
    	<div class="section" id="section1"><h1>"The World, we are told, is in the midst of a revolution.</h1>
        <p>The new tools of social media have reinvented social activism. With Facebook and Twitter and the like, the traditional relationship between political authority and popular will has been upended, making it easier for the powerless to collaborate, coordinate, and give voice to their concerns," Malcolm Gladwell cheekily writes in a piece for the New Yorker.  Popular culture certainly reinforces this narrative. We see it in the language the tech community has appropriated for its discussions (e.g., "revolutionary"; "disruptive"). And we see it in the headlines for more traditional media, as the BBC declared that, as of May 2012, the social media revolution had officially begun.  Mr. Gladwell, however, disagrees. He brings up several counterpoints: the lighting speed through with civil rights sit-ins spread throughout the American South in February of 1960 despite the lack of internet, email, and cellphones. The lack of critical examination by traditional media of the "Twitter revolutions" in Iran and Moldova misrepresenting the fact that most of those tweets were coming from the West, not from within the countries. (Why would the Iranian youth be tweeting in English and not Farsi?) He ends with quite an opposite conclusion: social media is not revolutionary, it merely enforces the status quo. </p>
<br>
<p>If the jury is still out on social media's larger societal impacts, surely the question as to its effects on architectural discourse has not been resolved. In order to examine the possible effects and the different voices answering this question, we can look to the city at the crux of social activism and the digital frontier: San Francisco.</p>        
        </div>
		<div class="section" id="section2"><h1>San Francisco is not a city shy in sharing its opinions. </h1>
        <p>Residents dodge political rallies, religious proselytizers, and the expectation of citizen activism due to the city's history. It is therefore unsurprising that the city--and its residents--are no less vocal about the architecture that constitutes it.  A dynasty of sharp-tongued architecture critics at the San Francisco Chronicle have, for decades, been pushing architectural conversations into the public realm. That, per city policy, any proposed building project can be subjected to a city-wide referendum has furthered the notion that "architecture" belongs to the people. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Simultaneously, however, San Francisco is facing an existential crisis as Silicon Valley permeates the peninsula and creeps into the city. The city has been at the forefront of the adopting technological trends as well as dealing with the conflicts that arise from them, such as the "sharing economy". If a consensus will be reached as to social media’s effects on the field of architecture, that consensus will likely be reached there. Luckily, San Francisco's booming real estate market gives us no shortage of fodder to discuss.</p>

        <h1>NO!</h1>
        <h1>If a tree tweets in a forest and no one is around to retweet it, does it make a sound?</h1>
        <p>Twitter, YouTube, and Blogs have broken the floodgates; a sea of self-appointed architectural critics have proliferated in the digital age. The question at hand is not whether these amateur theorists exist (that part is undeniable), but whether or not they will have an impact in architectural discourse. The latter part is much less certain. For as much as the field of architecture can be subjected to external pressure, when it comes to influencing opinions, who you are matters not just what you are saying.</p> 
        <br>
        <p>Although the internet and social media are novel innovations, their essential service is not new: they are a vehicle for sharing opinions. Though communication has gone through many evolutions (from developing spoken language, to writing, to the printing press, to radio, to television, and finally, to the internet), architecture has been dealing with opinions since its inception. Admittedly, it is easier for the average person to express their thoughts now than ever before, but that doesn’t mean architects are any more likely to listen. After all, Brett Steele in an interview in Log 28 proclaims that the point of architectural education in the 21st century is to create audiences for architecture.  Embedded in that statement is the following subtext: if you did not go through the architectural education process, you are not the intended audience for architecture. Before the general public proclaims its outrage over its exclusion from the conversation, it must remember it is in good company: that even Buckminster Fuller and Simon Rodia (Watts Towers) struggled with acceptance into the field.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide" id="slide3">
        <h1>YES!</h1>
        <h1>Social Media Will Revolutionize Architecture </h1><br><br>
        <p>"Eisenman: In the '90s people thought there was a digital revolution. There wasn't.
        <br>
        <br>Kipnis: But there has been since.
		<br>
        <br>Eisenman: What's happened since that makes you say that?
		<br>
        <br>Kipnis: Access and ease of use. Basically, You Tube,Facebook, Twitter." 
 		<br>
        <br>The role of architecture, and architects, in society has always been a fluid one. Peter Eisenman's and Jeffery Kipnis' discussion in Log 28 serves not only to highlight this ever-changing relationship, but also proposes that the real change of the digital revolution will arise from new tools for communication, not new tools for design. In the same issue of Log, Brett Steele discusses the major challenge facing architecture schools in the 21st century. He suggests that architectural education must shift from a service model of training architects, to an arena for events and discussions that constantly challenge the field. In other words, the architectural education should create an audience for architecture.  When these two conversations are taken together, a critical, digital question arises: If the internet allows these critical dialogues to expand beyond the walls of an architecture school, are audiences for architecture being created out of the general public? While trained or licensed architects may not agree, these digital audiences are tweeting loud and clear: "yes!"</p>
        </div>
	</div>
	<div class="section" id="section4">
    <div class="slide" id="slide1"><h1>No, Continued</h1>
    <p>This sense of exclusion also hints at a sense of cohesion that in all honesty probably misrepresents the current state of the field. A more accurate pictures emerges from Peggy Deamer’s “The Critical Problem,
Or, Talking Shop” in Log 30.
	<br>
    <br>The "In Pursuit of Architecture" conference organized by Log at the Museum of Modern Art in New York last September was an amazing display of critical crisis. While Sylvia Lavin decried that there was no crisis for the theorist to discuss, the wretchedness she acknowledged, and which was so palpably felt by the audience for both the critics and the architects (and Log editor Cynthia Davidson), indicated that a crisis in fact exists…
    <br>
    <br>The gauntlet was laid down by Freek Persyn when he said, in response to Whiting's question of whether any of the architects even read Log (suggesting that they did not), that he had once immersed himself in theory but now was more interested in pleasing his client. Wow! On the one hand: "Take that theorists! You are now irrelevant!" On the other: "Deal with this, because this is what an intelligent architect is thinking about." And deal with it the theorists could not. This, of course, is not surprising. Architecture theory since the mid-20th century has upheld its opposition to practice, implied that serving the client precludes ideas, suggested that architecture is not a service industry, and argued for the distinction between building and Architecture.</p></div>
    <div class="slide" id="slide2"><h1>Yes, Continued</h1>
	<p>Architects will not have to acknowledge the legitimacy (or lack thereof) of these self-proclaimed architecturaphiles for them to have an impact.  Particularly in an era where architecture is struggling with the lack of a universal guiding theory since the era of the critical project, these "uneducated" audiences have more ammunition that ever to affect architectural conversations. Case-in-point: San Francisco. 
	<br><br>
From SFCurbed's RFP for caricatures of Market Street's newest tower, to a satirical twitter account for the Nema luxury condo building (rentENEMA), examples of architectural critics by the general public are abound. Snohetta's recent gold-rush of big-named San Francisco project has particularly proven to be a double-edged sword. Another SFCurbed article entitled "New Designs for Warriors Arena Would Like You to Forget That Whole Toilet Debacle" chronicles the project's redesign after the general public lambasted the original design as a giant toilet seat. Indeed, the twitterverse can be an unforgiving place.
	<br><br>
But whether these critiques are justified or not, their impact cannot be ignored. While academic architects do not have to legitimize these comments in their theoretical discourses, practicing architects suffer from a debilitating condition: responding to clients, whose social media accounts get bombarded by these commentaries. Oft cited anecdotal evidence suggests that audiences despising new projects is nothing new. From the Eifel Tower, to the Chrysler Building, many of today's most beloved buildings suffered from horrific public approval ratings at their debut. While this shortsightedness persists amongst the general public, the public's ability to see post-construction renderings and audibly complain has been so greatly magnified that changes become inevitable. Example after example proves that after a negative public reaction to a design project, a press conference or publicity release quickly claims that these "preliminary" images were merely the first design iteration. They are often accompanied by a revised design.</p></div></div>
	<div class="section" id="section5">
    <div class="slide" id="slide1"><h1>No, Continued</h1>
    <P>In summary, the relationship between practicing architects and theorists and critics is often strained. If different aspects within the field can often dismiss each other’s opinions as illegitimate, one may assume that the opinion of those outside the field may be altogether irrelevant. But how can this be with the notion of social media as the great equalizer? The democratization of information?! Sadly, examples within the architectural realm tend to support Malcom Gladwell’s bleak view of the internet as a reinforcement of the existing inequalities of the status quo. This pessimism is highlighted by the recent controversy over the exclusion of Denise Scott Brown in the 1991 Pritzker Prize awarded to her husband and design partner, Robert Venturi. A Change.Org petition and Facebook campaign have gathered the support of nearly 20,000 people, notably including Ms. Scott Brown herself, as well as six Pritzker Prize winners (Mr. Venturi is also amongst the signatories). Despite this groundswell of support from the general public, architecture students, and practicing architects, the committee has decided that it is beyond their power to revisit the awards of previous committees. The exclusion of women from this award (only two have ever won) is seen to contribute to ongoing gender discrimination in the field, highlighted by the 32% Project. This organization seeks to address the imbalance that occurs sometime after the educational process when the percentage of women in the field drops from over 50% into the twenties.</P></div>
    <div class="slide" id="slide2"><h1>Yes, Concluded</h1>
    <p>Perhaps most telling of all, is that architects themselves are increasing being pulled into the fray. Local architect David Baker was recently caught off guard when he erroneously became the topic of conversation in a comment section for a project by a different designer. After jumping in to his own defense, Mr. Baker quickly realized the naiveté of the anonymous commenter, "Mike". Mike was actually criticizing a builder next to the one Mr. Baker designed. This example further proves that the audience need not properly "educated" to have an impact. Far from an isolated example, the AIA has been prompted to issue a guide for "Social Media and Architects." In it, internet veteran Jody Brown of the popular www.coffeewithanarchitect.com, discusses the digitally focused world we currently live in. Despite the sarcasm and self-deprecation that often pepper his blog,   Mr. Brown highlights the potential opportunities for increased communication and impact offered by social media. 
	<br><br>
Bjarke Ingles seems to have taken note. A Danish architect and principal of BIG, Ingles has made a name for himself not only through his bold design, but through his TedTalks. In them, he engages the architects and the general public equally, using the stage to debut his catchy slogan "Yes, is more". Ingles may embody the essence of the digital revolution envisioned by Kipnis. While it may take designers some time to recalibrate the equilibrium and their authority in internet-based discourse, Ingles and Brown show that those who take advantage of these new platforms can make quite a name for themselves. </p></div>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="section6"><h1>No, Continued</h1>
    <p>While this represents a notable failure on behalf of social media to affect change, some people may interpret the architectural conversation in San Francisco to be on a different trajectory. Recently, many projects have released renderings into the blogosphere only to be lambasted by anonymous internet commenters. Many of the projects were quickly revised, causing some to jump the gun and proclaim the indubious effect of social media on architectural discourse. This, however, is too literal a reading. It has become more and more common for architects working on highly publicized projects (e.g., basketball arenas) to release architectural snippets before the design process is actually complete. Is this truly a case of architects reaching out to the general public for input, or is it merely a distraction tactic, allowing the design process to move forward without constant public inquiries as to the state of the project? These recent examples may be too contemporary to truly examine, but another San Francisco project has withstood the test of time and--remaining despised for over 40 years—better reflects the public opinion processes. 
	<br><br>
The project is United Nations Plaza in San Francisco's Tenderloin.  Although technically within the realm of landscape architecture, this project provides an important case study as it has been under intense criticism for its design since its inception in the 1970s. A podcast about the plaza recalls its immediate derision as "awful, flamboyant, and an example of a designer's egotism getting passed onto the people as a piece of art" due to its untraditional fountain design. Others chided its emphasis on design despite its large homeless and drug-addicted population in the area, which quickly earned it the nickname Urination Plaza. This shows that San Franciscan's obsession with policing their built environment is not a new trend. An even stronger argument, however, is presented by the designer Lawrence Halprin, himself. Despite living into the age of social media (d. 2009), and hearing accounts of his design's unpopularity, both before and after twitter existed, Halprin remains faithful to his original vision:
	</p>
    </div>
	<div class="section" id="section7"><h1>No, Concluded</h1>
    <p>I'm not sure, even now, if I were going to be asked to design this how much I would change. I mean why would I change it, you're talking about my life's work for Christ's sake. I was the first person to design a plaza, a fountain, so that people could use it. People should not be told they cannot use a fountain, get inside of it, and use it. All places should be usable by people in the city. Now having said that...why would I design something to prevent homelessness? I mean, homelessness is a social problem that cannot be designed for in the sense of aesthetics and culture. Of course they [places] should be friendly. The real question is: what do you mean by friendly? No one has ever said to me you should design an unfriendly place. But you know it depends on who you talked to, when you say you've talked to people who say that sort of thing. Who are they? Sounds like a pretty stupid thing to say actually. I would challenge it. I can't imagine somebody would say something stupid like that.
    <br><br>
Halprin, undeterred by naysayers to his vision of good design for all people, went on to build many successful projects and is considered to be an influential contributor to the field of landscape architecture. He provides a glimmer of hope for young architects whose projects get attacked by the trolls of the internet. However, this is a conversation about a particular project. If design theories, already subject to the ebbs and flows of the prevailing fashions of time, are instead the product of the internet conversations can their demise be hastened? This would not be the first era in which architectural theory is impacted by a technology, and if public commentary indeed hastens the demise of theoretical ideas, it certainly won't be the last.
